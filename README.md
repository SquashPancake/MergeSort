# Merge Sort in C

This is a simple yet complete implementation of **Merge Sort** using recursion and temporary arrays in C.

It takes user input, allows "Done" to finish, sorts the values, and displays the sorted array.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Takes string input, parses integers
- Recognizes `"Done"` (case-insensitive)
- Implements merge sort with manual memory logic
- Written from scratch without standard libraries for sorting

## ðŸ–¥ How to Run

```bash
gcc main.c -o sort
./sort
